Exercises from Chapter 3 Functional Data Structures.

This repo is part of my blog series on
[Learning Elixir](http://learningelixir.joekain.com/) in which
I work through exercises from _Functional Programming in Scala_ using Elixir.

These exercises have a companion post,
[List Operations in Elixir - Part 1](http://learningelixir.joekain.com/2014/06/29/list-ops/),
that describes some of the more interesting exercises in detail.

If you'd like to work through the exercises yourself you can use my tests as
a guide.  To do this:

1. Clone the repo
2. Remove lib/functional_data_strcutres.ex and replace it with your own file.
3. Run `mix test`
4. Implement functions until the tests pass
