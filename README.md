Exercises from Chapter 3 Functional Data Structures.

This repo is part of my blog series on
[Learning Elixir](http://learningelixir.joekain.com/) in which
I work through exercises from _Functional Programming in Scala_ using Elixir.

These exercises have a companion post,
[List Operations in Elixir - Part 1](http://learningelixir.joekain.com/2014/06/29/list-ops/),
that describes some of the more interesting exercises in detail.
